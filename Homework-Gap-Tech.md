Scope:

As a result of COVID-19, many schools, from K12 institutions to universities,
have transitioned to online instruction. In many cases, however, students lack
adequate broadband access in their homes. The move to exclusive online
instruction has exacerbated what has been previously referred to as the
"homework gap", whereby students in various demographics are subject to
additional disadvantage as a result of the lack of resources and broadband
amenities.

Some schools, school districts, and municipalities have attempted to mitigate
this gap by distributing technology (e.g., laptops, tablets) to students, but
this technology is often of limited utility without Internet access. To solve
this problem, governments are exploring a range of options, from the purchase
of Internet service plans for citizens to the deployment of mesh networks
anchored at various municipal institutions (e.g, parks and libraries) to
Internet access that can be temporarily deployed in sparsely connected
neighborhoods (e.g., roving WiFi access points on school buses).

The range of possible deployment opportunities requires consideration of many
tradeoffs, among them being the technical capabilities of each solution, in
terms of performance, reliability, and scalability. For example, in the case
of mesh networks that are anchored at municipal institutions, questions of
privacy, security, and the design of the networked applications for
intermittent access are all considerations.

The paper will initially describe the means by which schools, school
districts, and cities have tried to meet this technical need thus far, and
explore the tradeoffs among various technical options for bridging these gaps.
The paper will also describe the technical challenges that are known to occur
in such solutions, based on network operator, equipment manufacturer and
software developer experience. 


This paper will assess technical options and recommendations for things such as
(1) backhaul from the WiFi network to the Internet, (2) authentication and
abuse traceback, (3) WiFi-layer optimizations, (4) active queue management
(AQM) optimizations to provide better quality video conferencing, (5) traffic
shaping mechaisms to provide service at peak times, and (6) other technical
recommendations. [TBD: The paper may also make recommendations on how to
measure the quality and reliability of these solutions in a standardized way
and to enable measurement of technical value (i.e. RoI).]

Out of scope - commentary on economic or policy issues; discussions of equity 
beyond the scope creating this gap.

graphics, tables, appendecies, footnotes and references.
