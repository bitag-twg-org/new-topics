This is a repository to support the work of the Broadband Internet Technical Advisory Group (BITAG) in seeking topics that could benefit from a cross-stakeholder technical perspective. For more information please see our website at https://www.bitag.org/.

Our current topic is an [Overview of Broadband Technologies](https://github.com/bitag-twg-org/new-topics/blob/main/broadband-tech-overview.md). 

We invite comment on our queue of potential topics listed in [Future-Topic-Queue.md](./Future-Topic-Queue.md). You can do this by creating or commenting on an Issue or creating or commenting on a Pull Request in this repository.

We will also post information about new topics that we decide to work on and invite interested parties to join these work efforts.

If you are interested in participating technically, please email dsicker@bitag.org. Please note that (1) your organization does NOT need to sign a membership agreement or pay membership or sponsorship due for you to participate technically. In addition, all reports include a disclaimer to the effect that just because you participated technically that this does not necessarily mean that your organization agrees with or endorses the report that is released from the BITAG.
