# Broadband Technology Overview

In today's increasingly interconnected world, access to high-speed internet has become a crucial component of modern life, as it is required for education, work, healthcare, and many other essential activities. As a result, the need for reliable and fast internet access has never been more important, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has forced many people to work, learn, and socialize from home. To meet this growing demand, there are a variety of broadband access technologies available, each with its own strengths and limitations. However, understanding the technical capabilities and applicability of these technologies can be challenging, particularly for stakeholders who need to make informed decisions about broadband deployment and funding.  

We aim to provide a multi-stakeholder overview of current and near-future broadband access technologies. The report does not recommend a particular technology but instead aims to state the capability and applicability of each technology. An inclusive multi-party perspective is critically important for balance, as different entities involved in the matter may have different requirements and interests. This report would appeal to a diverse audience, ranging from policymakers, regulators, and lawmakers to academic researchers, network engineers, historians, and many others. 

This report provides definitions of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), federal funding definitions, and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) definition, among others. The report includes an overview of the architecture, network protocols, infrastructure, customer equipment, operation, standards, and future roadmap for each of the following broadband access technologies: Hybrid Fiber Coaxial (HFC), Digital Subscriber Line, Fiber, Fixed wireless (licensed and unlicensed), Mobile, and Satellite.  

To present a balanced view of the various technologies, the report will examine several key factors that should be considered when choosing a broadband technology, including location, performance, cost, upgradability, and sustainability. We will highlight some of the current misunderstandings regarding the technical capabilities of various broadband access technologies, with the goal of providing accurate and up-to-date information. 

It should be noted that the last mile architecture cannot be evaluated in isolation and the entire Internet ecosystem between the communication source and destination must be analyzed to fully understand the impacts of the deployed broadband technology. The recommendations put forth include (TBD -taking a technology-neutral approach, funding research through federal agencies, and exploring future technology trends). 

In this report we attempt to provide a thorough and objective analysis of various factors related to broadband access, drawing on available research and measured data analytics. It is important to note that different technologies may use different measurement and monitoring platforms, making direct comparisons difficult. Nonetheless, our goal is to offer a fair and impartial overview of broadband access technologies, with a focus on assisting stakeholders in making informed decisions based on their individual needs and circumstances. In addition, we seek to identify gaps and potential areas for improvement that may benefit from further research funding.
