Scope:

When people think of Internet performance it is typically solely in terms of speed. But when considering the end user experience, latency can be a 
key factor. Unfortunately, latency is not well understood in the policy or regulatory spheres or by the average consumer. This paper will explain 
and explore latency as well as latency under load, including components of latency performance, how latency naturally varies by access technology and/or protocol and how latency can affect 
the user experience for certain types of applications such as video conferencing, remote learning, gaming and more. As well, while the FCC MBA program 
measures latency it takes no position on what is good or bad latency - a question this paper will explore. 
Additionally, this paper will examine metrics for characterizing latency performance, including various summary statistics for latency and latency variation (often referred to as "jitter"). Finally, the paper will look to the current state 
of the art and the future to explain Active Queue Management and low latency services and the new types of applications that this may enable.
